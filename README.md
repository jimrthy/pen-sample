pen-sample
==========

Sample of using the defunct penumbra project, if only because they're tough to find


# com.frereth/visuals

Experiment to see if I can get penumbra working with
a github dependency instead of pulling from clojars.

## Notes

Use lein git-deps to pull my branch of penumbra from github.

Then, in the .lein-git-deps/penumbra directory, run lein javac.

That should generate some .class files under
.lein-git-deps/penumbra/target/classes.

Copy them into the project-root/target/classes directory, recursively.
